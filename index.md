# About me 

I am a cybersecurity and networking student. This is a portfolio containing some projects I've done outside of my studies as part of trying to gain more knowledge on the fields I study. 

Since I have been pretty active in TryHackMe for the past year or so, I've decided to include some writeups as I've done them as part of my studies anyways and someone might find them useful. The writeups will not include direct answers, as I don't believe copypasting them from page to another actually teaches anything to anyone. I got BTL1-certification in the summer of 2025 and completed some Blue Team Labs Online rooms while studying for the exam, so I might include some BTLO-writeups later as I have been considering switching my focus to there instead of TryHackMe, as BTLO is more blue-team oriented, which is what  interests me the most. Some other projects included will be homelabs I've done, as soon as I get them documented well enough to publish them.
